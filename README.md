## 🫑 Features

The app presents:
- Something

- And another thing! 

## 🥨 Getting Started

This project is designed to run within a DevContainer, hence running it with VS Code + the devcontainers extenstion is advised.

1. Clone the repo 
2. Optional: reopen the project in the container (this will build and run it the first time)
3. Install deps ( I use yarn, you could also use p/npm if you want. )
4. Run dev script (yarn dev/npm run dev) 

### 🍌 Prerequisites
 
- Docker
- VSCode + devcontainers extenstion OR manually install the packaged deps (Node, yarn/npm, etc). 
- Web Browser
- A brain

## 🍍 Contributing
